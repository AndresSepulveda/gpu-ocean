    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this release of the GPU Ocean software is to provide code can be used to reproduce and regenerate results that are presented in the above paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, whereas the numerical schemes are implemented in CUDA and accessed through the PyCUDA library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data assimilation experiments are provided as Python scripts, whereas the post-processing of the results and visualization is generated in Jupyter Notebooks. "

    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the experiments or regenerate our results, you need the initial states and ensemble results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The true state and initial data used in the paper, and the files containing the complete results that we presented are available as *Supplementary Data for Massively Parallel Implicit Equal-Weights Particle Filter for Ocean Drift Trajectory Forecasting* under DOI [10.5281/zenodo.3457538](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3457538). The repository contains the following relevant folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `true_state/` True state and observations.\n",
    "  * `ensemble_init/` Ensemble initial states ($N_e = 100$)\n",
    "\n",
    "  In order to use these files, all the notebooks below expect the data repository to be located in `path/to/dir`, so that the NetCDF file containing the truth is available as `path/to/dir/true_state/double_jet_case_truth.nc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can generate your own true state and initial conditions, and then run the data-assimilation experiments. Instructions on how to do this is found below. **Note:** If you do this, you will be required to change some in order to use your newly generated true state/initial ensemble/forecast results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all experiments you are expected to provide a `media_dir` where the results are stored (the default will not work beside our local infrastructure) and in the postprocessin you will have to specify that folder again to read the output files!"
