    "The main purpose of this software is to provide code that evaluate the test cases presented in the paper, and reproduce the results. As a consequence, the implementation of the four numerical schemes are also provided.\n",

    "The code is written in Python, whereas the numerical schemes are implemented in OpenCL and accessed through the PyOpenCL library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each case is represented by a Jupyter Notebook. In some cases, two notebooks are provided for a single case, so that one notebook sets up the case and runs the simulations, wheareas the other do the post-processing and plotting. This way, the plots can be adjusted at any time without the need of rerunning the simulations, which may be time consuming depending on your available hardware."
