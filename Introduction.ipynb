    "The main purpose of this software is to provide code that set up, run, and evaluate four numerical schemes on the test cases presented in the paper, and reproduce the results. \n",

In some cases, two notebooks are provided for a single case, so that one notebook sets up the case and runs the simulations, wheareas the other do the post-processing and plotting. This way, the plots can be adjusted at any time without the need of rerunning the simulations, which may be time consuming depending on your available hardware."
